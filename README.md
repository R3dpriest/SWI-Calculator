Version 1.00
This version has:

A dyslectic writer... sorry in advanced

Indirect thanks to stack exchange and copilot for giving an example for the in and export function in a base64 string.

Javascript based database:
- Common wealth resources
- Sith resources
- Common wealth modules
- Sith Modules

Scripts:
- Dynamically generated big enough for resources and modules.
- Input fields tied to each module
- Dynamic math that calculates resources for each module
- Dynamic math that calculates resources for the station
- A script that exports the values of the imput fields to a unique string.
- A script that imports the unique string and alters input fields and calculates station.

v1.01
Layout:
- Removed two typo's
- Added some random style (buttons, etc)
- Added a grid to make the layout a little better
- Added Solarpower fields, and 2 additional unused options.

Scripts:
- Changed the logic and math to include solar power.
- Changed the in- and export function so that it included solarpower (and 2 optional fields)
- Changed the scripts arround and removed some old script that wasn't needed. (but was left as a option)

v1.02
Layout:
- Changing the grid based on window size. I noticed smarthphone sized windows cut if input fields.
- Changed the version numbering :)

v1.03
Layout:
- Added effeciency field
- Added an explenation on effeciency

Data:
- Added population field
- Added max effeciency

Script:
- Added population calculation
- Added effenciency based calculations
- Changed some scripts around to accomodate for this.

V1.04
Layout:
- Added dynamic classes
- Removed old static classes (this allows for more dynamic and better layouts and filtering)
- Added a menu for filtering

Data:
- Reworked the data to accomodate for dynamic filtering and layout
- Assigned the correct tiers to modules and resources

Scripts:
- Create a script that allows for users to manually hide/show certain fields. That should improve handeling of the volume of information

Known issue:
- Re-adding certain filters can be a bit wonky. Since you work with columns and rows. Where they meet can be a bit... weird.

v1.06

Layout: Mild changes

Scripts:  
- Added row and column highlighting, 
- Added automated row update.
- Added automated column update.
- Revamped the calculate button to actually calculate how much modules you need.

v1.07

Layout
