A dyslectic writer... sorry in advanced

Indirect thanks to stack exchange and copilot for giving an example for the in and export function in a base64 string.

Javascript based database:
- Common wealth resources
- Sith resources
- Common wealth modules
- Sith Modules

Scripts:
- Dynamically generated big enough for resources and modules.
- Input fields tied to each module
- Dynamic math that calculates resources for each module
- Dynamic math that calculates resources for the station
- A script that exports the values of the imput fields to a unique string.
- A script that imports the unique string and alters input fields and calculates station.

v1.01
Layout:
- Removed two typo's
- Added some random style (buttons, etc)
- Added a grid to make the layout a little better
- Added Solarpower fields, and 2 additional unused options.

Scripts:
- Changed the logic and math to include solar power.
- Changed the in- and export function so that it included solarpower (and 2 optional fields)
- Changed the scripts arround and removed some old script that wasn't needed. (but was left as a option)

v1.02
Layout:
- Changing the grid based on window size. I noticed smarthphone sized windows cut if input fields.
- Changed the version numbering :)
